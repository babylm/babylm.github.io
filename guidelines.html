<div class="paragraph"> Submissions should be implimented in Huggingface's Transformers library and can be submitted along one of three submission tracks. The data has been released and can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/babylm/babylm.github.io/raw/main/babylm_data.zip"; download="download">here</a>. </div>

<div class="title"> Submission Tracks </div>

<div class="paragraph"> We will evaluate models in three cateogries: <b> strict </b>, <b> strict-small </b> and <b> loose </b>. </div>

<div class="bullet"> <b> • Strict </b> and <b> Strict-Small: </b> The strict and strict-small tracks require that submissions are trained exclusively on a fixed dataset. The only difference between these tracks is the size of the dataset (~10M words vs. ~100M words). Winners will be determined based on performance on a shared evaluation set consisting of syntactic evaluation and NLU tasks. </div>

<div class="bullet"> <b> • Loose: </b> Submissions are still limited to ~100M words or less of training data, and will be tested on the shared evaluation set. However, they are permitted to use unlimited non-linguistic data. Additionally, training on additional text is allowed without limits if that text is generated by a model trained following the above restrictions. Winners will be selected holistically based on evaluation performance, relevance to the shared task goals, potential impact, and originality. </div>





<div class="title"> Pretraining Data </div>

<div class="paragraph"> We distribute a developmentally plausible pretraining dataset inspired by the input to children. Submissions must use only this training data to be considered for the strict and strict-small tracks, but may use alternate or additional data for other tracks. The dataset has the following properties: </div>


<div class="bullet"><b> • Under 100M words: </b> Children are exposed to 2M-7M words per year <a href="https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2016_AJSLP-15-0169"> (Gilkerson et al., 2017) </a>. Choosing the beginning of adolescence (age 13) as a cutoff, children are exposed to at maximum 91M words, which we round up to 100M. </div>

<div class="bullet"> <b> • Mostly transcribed speech: </b> Most of the input to children is spoken; thus, our dataset focuses on transcribed speech. </div>

<div class="bullet"> <b> • Mixed domain, consisting of the following sources: </b> CHILDES (child-directed speech), OpenSubtitles (speech), BNC (speech), TED talks (speech), children's books (simple written language). </div>

<div class="paragraph"> See the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11796">call for papers</a> for a detailed breakdown of the pretraining datasets.</div>


<div class="title"> Evaluation Pipeline </div>

<div class="paragraph"> Models will be evaluated on a shared pipeline, hosted <a href="https://github.com/babylm/evaluation-pipeline">at this GitHub link</a>.</div>

<div class="paragraph"> The public validation data we use is a mixture of BLiMP and (Super)GLUE tasks. We will hold out additional tasks for our final evaluation of submitted
  models.
