<div class="paragraph"> Submissions should be implimented in Huggingface's Transformers library and can be submitted along one of three submission tracks. The data has been released and can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/babylm/babylm.github.io/raw/main/babylm_data.zip"; download="download">here</a>. </div>

<div class="title"> Submission Tracks </div>

<div class="paragraph"> We will evaluate models in three cateogries: <b> strict </b>, <b> strict-small </b> and <b> loose </b>. </div>

<div class="bullet"> <b> • Strict </b> and <b> Strict-Small: </b> The strict and strict-small tracks require that submissions are trained exclusively on a fixed dataset. The only difference between these tracks is the size of the dataset (~10M words vs. ~100M words). Winners will be determined based on performance on a shared evaluation set consisting of syntactic evaluation and NLU tasks. </div>

<div class="bullet"> <b> • Loose: </b> Submissions are still limited to ~100M words or less of training data, and will be tested on the shared evaluation set. However, they are permitted to use unlimited non-linguistic data. Additionally, training on additional text is allowed without limits if that text is generated by a model trained following the above restrictions. Winners will be selected holistically based on evaluation performance, relevance to the shared task goals, potential impact, and originality. </div>





<div class="title"> Pretraining Data </div>

<div class="paragraph"> We distribute a developmentally plausible pretraining dataset inspired by the input to children. Submissions must use only this training data to be considered for the strict and strict-small tracks, but may use alternate or additional data for other tracks. The dataset has the following properties: </div>


<div class="bullet"><b> • Under 100M words: </b> Children are exposed to 2M-7M words per year <a href="https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/2016_AJSLP-15-0169"> (Gilkerson et al., 2017) </a>. Choosing the beginning of adolescence (age 13) as a cutoff, children are exposed to at maximum 91M words, which we round up to 100M. </div>

<div class="bullet"> <b> • Mostly transcribed speech: </b> Most of the input to children is spoken; thus, our dataset focuses on transcribed speech. </div>

<div class="bullet"> <b> • Mixed domain, consisting of the following sources: </b> CHILDES (child-directed speech), 
  Subtitles (speech), BNC (speech), TED talks (speech), children's books (simple written language). </div>

<div class="paragraph"> See the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11796">call for papers</a> for a detailed breakdown of the pretraining datasets.</div>


<div class="title"> Evaluation Pipeline </div>

<div class="paragraph"> Models will be evaluated on a shared pipeline, hosted <a href="https://github.com/babylm/evaluation-pipeline">at this GitHub link</a>.</div>

<div class="paragraph"> The public validation data we use is a mixture of BLiMP and (Super)GLUE tasks. We will hold out additional tasks for our final evaluation of submitted
  models.
</div>
  

<div class="title"> Paper Submissions </div>
  
  <div class="paragraph"> The deadline for paper submissions is <strong>August 1, 23:59 anywhere on earth</strong>.</div>
  <div class="paragraph"> 
    Submissions must be made through our <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP/2023/Workshop/CoNLL-CMCL_Shared_Task/BabyLM_Challenge">OpenReview portal</a>.
    We accept two types of paper submissions:
  </div>
  
  <div class="bullet"><b>•</b> Archival full papers (up to 8 pages)</div>
  <div class="bullet"><b>•</b> Non-archival extended abstract (up to 2 pages)</div>
  
  <div class="paragraph"> Submissions of both types are:</div>

  <div class="bullet"><b>•</b> required to use the <a href="https://2023.emnlp.org/calls/main_conference_papers/#paper-submission-and-templates">EMNLP 2023 template</a>,</div>
  <div class="bullet"><b>•</b> given unlimited space for references,</div>
  <div class="bullet"><b>•</b> given unlimited space for appendices,</div>
  <div class="bullet"><b>•</b> given extra space for ethics/limitations, though these sections are optional</div>

  
  <div class="paragraph">We allow dual submissions of archival papers with one of the co-sponsored workshops (CoNLL and CMCL). In the event that an archival paper is accepted to both BabyLM and one of these workshops, it can only appear in one of their proceedings (i.e., it must be withdrawn from one venue). </div>

  <div class="paragraph">BabyLM will hold its own review process, separate from CoNLL and CMCL, and the proceedings will appear in their own volume. The acceptance criteria are based on soundness: We plan only to reject submissions that make incorrect or unjustified claims. Other feedback will be directed at the improvement of submissions.</div>
