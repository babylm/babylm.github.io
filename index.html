<div class="paragraph"> <b> Summary: </b> The BabyLM Challenge will be held again in 2024! The overarching goals of the challenge remain the same, however some of the rules are different for this year. See below for an overview of rules updates. </div>

<div class="bullet"> • For the strict and strict-mall track: <a href="https://github.com/babylm/babylm.github.io/raw/main/babylm_data.zip"; download="download">Download Text-Only Dataset (700MB unzipped)</a></div>

<div class="bullet"> • For the multi-modal track: <a href=""; download="download">Download Instructions for Text-Image Dataset</a></div>

<div class="bullet"> • Check here for evaluation pipeline (late April) </a> </div>

<div class="paragraph"> See the <a href="guidelines.html">guidelines</a> for an overview of submission tracks and pretraining data. See the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11796">updated call for papers</a> for a detailed description of the task setup and data. </div>

<div class="paragraph"> Consider <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/babylmchallenge/shared_invite/zt-1s8el4mro-qvVO447l3POBZcUNvMWQcg">joining the BabyLM Slack</a> if you have any questions for the organizers or want to connect with other participants!</div>

<div class="title"> Rules Updates for BabyLM Round 2 </div> <br>

<div class="bullet"> • Human language learning is inherently multi-modal. To encourage more multi-modal submissions, <b> we are replacing last year's loose track with a vision-language track . </b> We will release a corpus of 50% text-only and 50% image-text multimodal data. </a></div>

<div class="bullet"> • Last year, all competition entrants were required to pretrain on a fixed corpus. This year we will relax this requirement. While we will still provide language-only and multi-modal datasets of 100M and 10M words, <b> participants are free to construct their own datasets, provided that they stay within the 100M or 10M word budget. </b>. </a></div>

<div class="bullet"> • To encourage contributions that are related to the goals of the challenge, but do not involve direct competition entries, <b> we are introducing a paper-only track.</b> Paper track submissions could include things like novel cognitively-inspired evaluation metrics or in-depth analyses of one particular BabyLM model. </a></div>

<div class="title"> Overview </div> <br>
  
    <img style="float: right; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 15px;" src="./images/model_sizes.png" height="160"> 

<div class="paragraph"> Huge effort has been put into optimizing LM pretraining at massive scales in the last several years. While growing parameter counts often get the most attention, datasets have also grown by orders of magnitude. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556v1"> Chinchilla </a> sees 1.4 <b>trillion</b> words during training---well over 10000 words for every one word a 13 year old child has heard in their entire life.</div>

<div class="paragraph"> The goal of this shared task is to incentivize researchers with an interest in pretraining or cognitive modeling to focus their efforts on optimizing pretraining given data limitations inspired by human development. Additionally, we hope to democratize research on pretraining—which is typically thought to be practical only for large industry groups—by drawing attention to open problems that can be addressed on a university budget. </div>

<div class="title" > Why <100 Million Words? </div>
  
<div class="paragraph"> Focusing on scaled down pretraining has several potential benefits: <br> First, small scale pretraining can be a sandbox for developing novel techniques for improving data efficiency. These techniques have the potential to then scale up to larger scales commonly seen in applied NLP or used to enhance current approaches to modeling low-resource languages. Second, improving our ability to train LMs on the same kinds and quantities of data that humans learn from hopefully will give us greater access to plausible cognitive models of humans and help us understand what allows humans to acquire language so efficiently. </div>
